# Common Terminology: Isaac AI-Robot Brain

This document provides consistent definitions for key terms used throughout the Isaac module.

## Key Terms

- **AI Perception**: The capability of robots to sense and understand their environment using cameras, depth sensors, and other sensory systems to enable intelligent behavior

- **Isaac Sim**: NVIDIA's robotics simulator that provides photorealistic simulation environments for training AI perception models safely and efficiently

- **Synthetic Data Generation**: The process of creating labeled training data using simulation environments instead of real-world data collection, enabling safe and scalable AI model training

- **VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: A technique that allows robots to map their environment and determine their position within it using visual sensors

- **Isaac ROS**: NVIDIA's collection of hardware-accelerated perception and navigation packages that integrate with ROS 2 for enhanced robot capabilities

- **Nav2**: The ROS 2 navigation stack that provides path planning and execution capabilities for robot navigation

- **Bipedal Navigation**: Navigation algorithms specifically designed for two-legged humanoid robots, accounting for balance and gait constraints

- **Perception Pipeline**: System for processing sensor data to understand the environment

- **Humanoid Robot**: Robot designed with human-like structure including joints, links, and degrees of freedom

- **Photorealistic Simulation**: Computer-generated environments that closely mimic real-world appearance and physics
