# Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book! In this module, we'll explore the concept of Digital Twins and how they revolutionize robotics development through simulation environments.

## Overview

A Digital Twin is a virtual replica of a physical system that mirrors real-world properties, behaviors, and interactions. In robotics, it allows for testing and development without physical hardware, making it possible to experiment safely and efficiently.

This module is structured into three chapters:

- **Chapter 1**: Digital Twin Fundamentals - Understanding the core concepts and why simulation matters
- **Chapter 2**: Physics & Environment Simulation with Gazebo - Learning about physics-based simulation
- **Chapter 3**: Visual Realism & Human Interaction with Unity - Exploring high-fidelity visualization

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
- Explain what a Digital Twin is and why it's essential for robotics development
- Understand how physics simulation affects robot behavior
- Conceptually describe sensor simulation and its purpose
- Understand the complementary roles of Gazebo and Unity in Digital Twin environments

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Knowledge of ROS 2 from Module 1 (recommended but not required)

Let's begin our journey into the world of simulation and Digital Twins!
