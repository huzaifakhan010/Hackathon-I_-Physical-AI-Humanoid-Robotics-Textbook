# Chapter 2: Physics & Environment Simulation with Gazebo

Welcome to Chapter 2 of Module 2! In this chapter, we'll dive into the physics simulation capabilities of Gazebo and learn how to create realistic environments for humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:
- Understand fundamental physics concepts that govern robot behavior in simulation
- Explain how gravity, friction, and collisions affect robot movement
- Create robot environments with appropriate physical properties
- Conceptually describe how sensors are simulated in Gazebo
- Understand the importance of physics simulation for humanoid robot development
