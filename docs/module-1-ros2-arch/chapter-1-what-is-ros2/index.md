# Chapter 1: What is ROS 2 and Why Robots Need It

Welcome to Chapter 1! In this chapter, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 architecture as a robotic nervous system. You'll understand how ROS 2 serves as middleware that connects different components of a humanoid robot system, enabling communication between perception, decision-making, and actuation modules.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Explain what ROS 2 is in simple terms using real-world analogies
- Understand the role of ROS 2 in robot control and communication
- Identify key architectural components (nodes, topics, services)
- Describe how ROS 2 fits into a humanoid robot system

## Chapter Overview

This chapter introduces you to ROS 2 as the "nervous system" of a robot. We'll use real-world analogies to explain complex concepts and help you understand why robots need middleware like ROS 2 to function effectively.

## Topics Covered

- [Middleware explained with real-world analogies](./middleware-analogies.md)
- [ROS 2 architecture overview (nodes, messages, executors)](./architecture-overview.md)
- [Exercises and self-assessment](./exercises.md)

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of what a robot is
- No prior ROS experience required

## Next Steps

After completing this chapter, you'll have a solid foundation in ROS 2 architecture that will help you understand the more detailed communication patterns in Chapter 2.
