# Chapter 3: Python Control and Robot Description

Welcome to Chapter 3! In this chapter, you'll learn how to connect Python-based AI agents to ROS 2 using the rclpy library and understand how humanoid robots are described using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format). We'll bridge the gap between high-level AI decision-making and low-level robot control with practical examples and clear explanations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Use the rclpy Python client library to create ROS 2 nodes
- Connect AI agents to robot controllers using Python
- Understand the basics of URDF for robot description
- Explain how joints, links, and sensors are defined in URDF
- Connect Python agents to robot simulation environments
- Implement basic control commands from Python to robots

## Chapter Overview

This chapter focuses on the practical connection between Python-based AI systems and ROS 2 robot control systems. You'll learn how to use the rclpy library to create nodes that can both receive sensor data from robots and send control commands to them. Additionally, you'll explore URDF, the standard format for describing robot structure, which is essential for both simulation and real robot control.

## Topics Covered

- [Python-ROS 2 Integration with rclpy](./python-rclpy-integration.md)
- [Bridging AI Agents to Robot Controllers](./ai-robot-bridging.md)
- [Introduction to URDF for Humanoid Robots](./urdf-introduction.md)
- [Joints, Links, and Sensors in Robot Description](./joints-links-sensors.md)
- [Connecting to Simulation Environments](./simulation-connection.md)

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of ROS 2 architecture (Chapter 1)
- Knowledge of communication patterns (Chapter 2)
- Basic Python programming skills

## Next Steps

After completing this chapter, you'll have the knowledge to connect Python-based AI systems to ROS 2 robots and understand how robots are described and modeled in simulation. You can also review the [Module Overview](../) to see how all concepts connect together, or explore the [Reference Materials](../../../reference/ros2-api-reference) and [Tutorials](../../../tutorials/ros2-basics/) for additional learning resources.
