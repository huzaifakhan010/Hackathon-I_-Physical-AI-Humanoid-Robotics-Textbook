# Chapter 2: Communication in ROS 2 (Nodes, Topics, Services)

Welcome to Chapter 2! In this chapter, you'll learn how nodes communicate in ROS 2 using different patterns. We'll explore how nodes publish/subscribe to topics and use request/response services for robot control, with clear step-by-step explanations and visual diagrams.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand how nodes communicate using different patterns
- Distinguish between topics, services, and other communication methods
- Explain publisher/subscriber and request/response patterns
- Identify when to use each communication pattern

## Chapter Overview

This chapter focuses on the core communication mechanisms in ROS 2 that enable distributed robotics. You'll learn how robot components interact and build on the architectural foundation from Chapter 1.

## Topics Covered

- [Understanding Nodes and Their Behavior](./nodes-behavior.md)
- [Topics and Data Flow](./topics-data-flow.md)
- [Services and Request-Response Patterns](./services-request-response.md)
- [Message Flow Examples](./message-flow-examples.md)
- [Common Beginner Mistakes and Mental Models](./beginner-mistakes.md)

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of basic ROS 2 architecture (Chapter 1)
- Basic Python knowledge

## Next Steps

After completing this chapter, you'll understand the core communication patterns that make ROS 2 powerful for distributed robotics applications. Continue to [Chapter 3](../chapter-3-python-control-urdf/) to learn how to connect Python-based AI agents to ROS 2 and understand robot description with URDF.
