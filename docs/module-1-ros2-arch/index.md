# Module 1: Architecture and the Robotic Nervous System

Welcome to the ROS 2 Architecture module! This module will introduce you to ROS 2 as the "robotic nervous system" - the middleware that connects different components of a humanoid robot system, enabling communication between perception, decision-making, and actuation modules.

## About This Module

This module is designed for beginners to intermediate learners in Robotics and AI who want to understand how ROS 2 works as the communication backbone for humanoid robots. We'll use real-world analogies and simple language to explain complex concepts.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Explain what ROS 2 is in simple terms
- Understand how robots exchange data using ROS 2
- Conceptually design a ROS 2 system
- Understand how a humanoid robot is structured using URDF

## Chapter Overview

1. [**What is ROS 2 and Why Robots Need It**](./chapter-1-what-is-ros2/) - Understanding ROS 2 as middleware with real-world analogies
2. [**Communication in ROS 2 (Nodes, Topics, Services)**](./chapter-2-communication-patterns/) - How robots communicate using Nodes, Topics, and Services
3. [**Python Control and Robot Description**](./chapter-3-python-control-urdf/) - How Python agents control robots using rclpy and how humanoid robots are described using URDF

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- No prior robotics or ROS experience required

## Getting Started

Start with [Chapter 1](./chapter-1-what-is-ros2/) to understand the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 architecture as a robotic nervous system. Each chapter builds on the previous one but can also be read independently for focused learning.

## Success Criteria

After completing this module, you should be able to:
- Explain ROS 2 in simple words using real-world analogies
- Understand how robots exchange data using ROS 2 communication patterns
- Conceptually design a ROS 2 system for a humanoid robot
- Understand how a humanoid robot is structured using URDF and how Python agents connect to it
