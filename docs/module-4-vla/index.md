# Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Integration

## Module Overview

This module focuses on integrating Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems for humanoid robots, combining voice recognition, cognitive planning with LLMs, and ROS 2 action execution. The content targets graduate students and advanced learners in AI & Robotics.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Understand how LLMs can control robot actions using vision-language-action integration
- Implement voice-to-action pipelines using OpenAI Whisper for robot control
- Translate natural language commands into ROS 2 action sequences
- Conceptualize and implement the capstone autonomous humanoid project

## Prerequisites

This module assumes prior knowledge of:
- ROS 2 concepts (covered in Module 1)
- AI-Robot Brain concepts (covered in Module 3)
- Simulation basics

## Chapter Navigation

1. [Chapter 1: Voice-to-Action with OpenAI Whisper](./chapter-1-voice-to-action/)
2. [Chapter 2: Cognitive Planning and ROS 2 Action Sequencing](./chapter-2-cognitive-planning/)
3. [Chapter 3: Capstone Project – Autonomous Humanoid Integration](./chapter-3-capstone/)

## Success Metrics

Students will demonstrate competency by:
- Implementing voice-to-action pipelines with 90% accuracy
- Successfully translating natural language commands to ROS 2 action sequences
- Conceptualizing the capstone autonomous humanoid project
- Completing all exercises with demonstrated competency
