# VLA Module Terminology Guide

## Core Concepts

### Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
- **Definition**: The integration of visual perception, natural language processing, and robotic action execution in a unified system
- **Usage**: Always use "Vision-Language-Action" or "VLA" when referring to the complete system

### Voice Command
- **Definition**: Natural language input from users that needs to be processed and converted to robot actions
- **Usage**: Use for any spoken input that requires processing

### Action Sequence
- **Definition**: Series of ROS 2 actions generated from voice commands, potentially involving navigation, manipulation, perception, and cognitive planning steps
- **Usage**: Use for the ordered set of actions generated from a single command

### Cognitive Plan
- **Definition**: High-level plan generated by LLMs that breaks down complex commands into executable action sequences with consideration of environmental constraints
- **Usage**: Use for the high-level planning step that occurs before action generation

### VLA System
- **Definition**: Integrated system combining Vision, Language, and Action components to enable autonomous humanoid behavior based on voice commands
- **Usage**: Use for the complete integrated system

## Technical Terms

### OpenAI Whisper
- **Definition**: Speech-to-text technology used for voice recognition
- **Usage**: Always capitalize as "OpenAI Whisper"

### ROS 2
- **Definition**: Robot Operating System version 2, used for robot communication and control
- **Usage**: Always format as "ROS 2"

### LLM
- **Definition**: Large Language Model, used for cognitive planning
- **Usage**: Use "LLM" for general references, "Large Language Model" on first use

### Humanoid Robot
- **Definition**: Robot with human-like form and capabilities
- **Usage**: Use "humanoid robot" for general references, avoid "human-like robot"

## Consistency Guidelines

- Always use "voice command" rather than "voice input" or "spoken command"
- Use "action sequence" instead of "action plan" or "action list"
- Use "cognitive planning" instead of "cognitive reasoning" when referring to the planning process
- Use "execute on robot" rather than "send to robot" or "run on robot"
- Use "voice-to-action pipeline" as a single term when referring to the complete process
