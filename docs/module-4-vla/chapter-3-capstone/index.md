# Chapter 3: Capstone Project – Autonomous Humanoid Integration

## Overview

This capstone chapter integrates all Vision-Language-Action (VLA) concepts learned in the previous chapters to create a complete autonomous humanoid system. Students will implement a system that responds to voice commands, performs cognitive planning, and executes complex behaviors in real-world scenarios.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:
- Integrate all VLA components into a cohesive system
- Implement autonomous behavior in humanoid robots
- Handle complex multi-step tasks with proper error handling
- Apply all learned concepts in a comprehensive project

## Chapter Structure

1. [Capstone Implementation](./capstone-implementation.md)
2. [Autonomous Behavior](./autonomous-behavior.md)
3. [System Integration Patterns](./system-integration.md)
4. [Exercises](./exercises.md)

## Prerequisites

- Complete understanding of Chapters 1 and 2
- Working knowledge of ROS 2 systems
- Experience with humanoid robot simulation environments

## Success Criteria

Students will demonstrate competency by implementing a complete VLA system that can receive voice commands, perform cognitive planning, and execute complex multi-step tasks on a humanoid robot with appropriate error handling and safety measures.
