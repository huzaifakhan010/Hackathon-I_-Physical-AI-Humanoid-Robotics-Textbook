# Chapter 2: Cognitive Planning and ROS 2 Action Sequencing

## Overview

This chapter explores cognitive planning systems using Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret complex natural language commands and generate appropriate ROS 2 action sequences. Students will learn to break down complex commands into executable sequences of robot actions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:
- Implement cognitive planning systems using LLMs
- Translate complex natural language commands into ROS 2 action sequences
- Handle multi-step commands with dependencies
- Apply constraint handling in cognitive planning

## Chapter Structure

1. [LLM Integration](./llm-integration.md)
2. [Action Sequencing](./action-sequencing.md)
3. [Cognitive Planning Implementation](./cognitive-planning-implementation.md)
4. [Exercises](./exercises.md)

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of Chapter 1 (Voice-to-Action Pipeline)
- Basic knowledge of ROS 2 action servers and clients
- Familiarity with LLM concepts and APIs

## Success Criteria

Students will demonstrate competency by implementing a cognitive planning system that can interpret complex multi-step commands and generate appropriate ROS 2 action sequences with proper dependency handling and constraint management.
