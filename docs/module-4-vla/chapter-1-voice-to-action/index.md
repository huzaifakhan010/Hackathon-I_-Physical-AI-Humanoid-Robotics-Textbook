# Chapter 1: Voice-to-Action with OpenAI Whisper

## Overview

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of voice-to-action pipelines using OpenAI Whisper for humanoid robotics applications. Students will learn how to process voice input, transcribe it to text, and map it to specific ROS 2 action sequences.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:
- Understand the architecture of voice recognition systems
- Implement basic voice-to-action pipelines using OpenAI Whisper
- Map transcribed commands to ROS 2 action sequences
- Handle common challenges in voice processing for robotics

## Chapter Structure

1. [Voice Recognition Concepts](./voice-recognition-concepts.md)
2. [Whisper Integration](./whisper-integration.md)
3. [Voice-to-Action Pipeline](./voice-to-action-pipeline.md)
4. [Exercises](./exercises.md)

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts
- Python programming experience
- Familiarity with API integration

## Success Criteria

Students will demonstrate competency by implementing a working voice-to-action pipeline that can receive voice commands and execute corresponding robot actions with at least 80% accuracy.
