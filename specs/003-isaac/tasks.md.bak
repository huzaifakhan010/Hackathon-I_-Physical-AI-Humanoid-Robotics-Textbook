## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Reference Materials (Phase 6)**: Can start after Foundational phase
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May build on US1 concepts but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US1/US2 concepts but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Conceptual content before practical examples
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Content files within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---
## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all content files for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create chapter 1 index file at docs/module-3-isaac/chapter-1-sim-synthetic/index.md"
Task: "Create Isaac Sim concepts file at docs/module-3-isaac/chapter-1-sim-synthetic/isaac-sim-concepts.md"
Task: "Create photorealistic rendering content at docs/module-3-isaac/chapter-1-sim-synthetic/photorealistic-rendering.md"
Task: "Create synthetic data generation content at docs/module-3-isaac/chapter-1-sim-synthetic/synthetic-data-gen.md"
Task: "Create exercises file at docs/module-3-isaac/chapter-1-sim-synthetic/exercises.md"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---
## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
