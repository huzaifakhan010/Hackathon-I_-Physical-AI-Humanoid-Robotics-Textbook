# AI/Spec-Driven Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Technical Accuracy and Real-World Alignment
All technical claims must align with official documentation from ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, OpenAI, and other authoritative sources. Code examples must be executable or clearly labeled as pseudocode to maintain credibility and educational value.

### Graduate-Level Clarity for AI & Robotics Learners
Content must be accessible to graduate students in AI and Robotics programs, balancing theoretical depth with practical application. Terminology must be consistent across AI, robotics, and simulation domains to avoid confusion.

### Spec-Driven Reproducible Content Generation
All content creation follows Spec-Kit Plus methodology with formal specifications driving implementation. Every chapter, example, and feature must begin with a clear specification before implementation to ensure consistency and completeness.

### Embodied Intelligence and Humanoid Systems Focus
Development prioritizes practical applications in embodied intelligence and humanoid robotics systems. Content must emphasize the integration of perception, cognition, and action in physical systems rather than abstract AI concepts.

### Modular and Self-Contained Chapters
Each chapter and module must be designed as a standalone unit with clear dependencies and learning objectives. This enables flexible curriculum design and allows readers to engage with topics in non-linear fashion without losing continuity.

### Integrated RAG Chatbot Functionality
The embedded RAG chatbot must strictly answer from book content or user-selected text, ensuring accuracy and preventing hallucination. The chatbot serves as an intelligent study aid rather than a general-purpose AI assistant.

## Additional Technical Constraints

- Format: Markdown compatible with Docusaurus for seamless documentation generation
- Authoring: Claude Code + Spec-Kit Plus for reproducible, high-quality content
- Deployment: GitHub Pages for public accessibility and version control
- Code inclusion: Python, ROS 2, URDF, and pseudocode examples for hands-on learning
- Simulation environments: ROS 2 (robotic nervous system), Gazebo & Unity (digital twins)
- Hardware focus: NVIDIA Isaac (perception, navigation), Vision-Language-Action with LLMs

## Development Workflow Standards

- Content validation: All technical claims verified against official documentation
- Code testing: Examples must be executable or clearly marked as conceptual
- Cross-referencing: Consistent linking between related concepts and chapters
- Review process: Technical accuracy validated by domain experts
- Quality gates: Content must meet educational objectives before publication

## Governance

This constitution governs all aspects of the AI/Spec-Driven Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics project. All development activities must comply with these principles. Amendments require documentation of changes, approval from project stakeholders, and a migration plan for existing content. All pull requests and reviews must verify constitutional compliance. Complexity must be justified with clear educational or technical benefits. Use this constitution as the primary guidance document for all development decisions.
