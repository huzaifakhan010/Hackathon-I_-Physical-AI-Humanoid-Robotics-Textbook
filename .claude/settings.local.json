It covers the depth of content to be included, the focus of perception topics, and the scope of navigation coverage for the Isaac module.\n\n## Decision 1: Isaac Sim Training Pipelines Depth\n\n**Issue**: What depth of Isaac Sim training pipelines should be covered - conceptual overview vs detailed implementation?\n\n**Rationale**: Given the target audience of beginners to intermediate learners, the content should focus on conceptual understanding rather than detailed implementation. The goal is to help students understand why Isaac Sim is valuable for creating synthetic data to train perception models, without overwhelming them with complex training pipeline details.\n\n**Decision**: Cover conceptual overview of Isaac Sim''s role in synthetic data generation for perception training, with simple examples of how photorealistic simulation creates training datasets. Avoid detailed implementation of actual training pipelines.\n\n**Alternatives Considered**:\n- Detailed training pipeline implementation: Too advanced for target audience\n- Complete conceptual overview: Might lack sufficient practical understanding\n- Balanced approach: Selected - conceptual focus with practical examples\n\n## Decision 2: Perception Focus Scope\n\n**Issue**: Should perception focus on visual perception only or include multi-sensor fusion concepts?\n\n**Rationale**: The Isaac ecosystem primarily emphasizes visual perception through cameras and depth sensors. For beginners, focusing on visual perception (VSLAM) provides a clear learning path. Multi-sensor fusion is an advanced topic that would be overwhelming for the target audience.\n\n**Decision**: Focus primarily on visual perception including cameras and depth sensors, with brief mention of how other sensors might be integrated. Emphasize VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) as the core concept.\n\n**Alternatives Considered**:\n- Multi-sensor fusion: Too complex for beginner audience\n- Visual perception only: Selected - appropriate for learning progression\n- LIDAR focus: Isaac ecosystem is more camera/depth-centric\n\n## Decision 3: Navigation Scope\n\n**Issue**: What navigation scope is appropriate - conceptual Nav2 planning vs configuration details?\n\n**Rationale**: For beginners to intermediate learners, understanding the concepts of navigation and path planning is more important than detailed configuration. The focus should be on how Isaac ROS and Nav2 work together conceptually, with minimal configuration details.\n\n**Decision**: Cover conceptual understanding of Nav2 path planning for humanoid robots, with minimal configuration examples. Focus on the integration of Isaac ROS perception with Nav2 navigation rather than detailed parameter tuning.\n\n**Alternatives Considered**:\n- Detailed configuration: Too advanced for target audience\n- Pure conceptual: Might lack practical understanding\n- Balanced approach: Selected - conceptual focus with minimal practical examples\n\n## Additional Research Findings\n\n### Isaac Sim Architecture\n- Isaac Sim uses USD (Universal Scene Description) for scene representation\n- Provides photorealistic rendering capabilities for synthetic data generation\n- Integrates with Isaac ROS for perception pipeline development\n- Works with various sensor models (cameras, depth, LIDAR, IMU)\n\n### Isaac ROS Components\n- Hardware-accelerated perception packages\n- Sensor processing nodes optimized for NVIDIA GPUs\n- Integration with standard ROS 2 ecosystem\n- VSLAM capabilities for localization and mapping\n\n### Humanoid Navigation Considerations\n- Bipedal locomotion requires specialized path planning\n- Balance and gait constraints affect navigation\n- Nav2 can be configured for humanoid-specific requirements\n- Isaac ecosystem provides tools for humanoid-specific navigation\n\n## References\n\n- NVIDIA Isaac Sim Documentation\n- Isaac ROS Package Documentation\n- ROS 2 Navigation (Nav2) Documentation\n- Official NVIDIA Isaac Examples and Tutorials\")",
